# Game of Life Visualisation Project

I previously completed a coding challenge to make a JavaScript implementation of [Conway's Game of Life using TDD](https://github.com/SarahFrench/ConwayGameOfLife). When I started learning React I chose to create a simple visualisation of Conways Game of Life to learn about managing state in class and functional components.

The deployed project can be seen at [https://sarahfrench.github.io/react-game-of-life/](https://sarahfrench.github.io/react-game-of-life/).

The project can be run locally by:

- cloning the repo
- `$ npm i`
- `$ npm start`
